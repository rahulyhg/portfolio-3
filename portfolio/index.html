            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>As a software generalist, I love positions where I can wear many hats, from developing web user interfaces to writing Linux scripts to automate a build or deployment process. I am experienced enough to recommend designs, approaches, and tools. I'm also flexible and willing to adopt and contribute to existing processes. I enjoy the challenge of launching a new project, but I recogize that most of a developer's work involves building on the work of others, and I'm not above diving into existing code to make enhancements and fix bugs, even if the code is in a language I've never seen before.</p>

         <div class="about-right-col">
            <h2>Leadership</h2>
            <p>With three years of experience as a software project manager, I can take ownership of all aspects of getting a new or redesigned product off the ground and launched. From requirements definition through wireframes and usability testing to implementation and deployment, I enjoy managing the details and interacting with all of the involved stakeholders. I have experience with the tools and techniques involved in leading an agile development team. Most importantly, I love working with and learning from teams of great people.</p>

The tool and the framework are implemented using PHP, JavaScript and Ext-js, OpenLayers, and PostGIS. I contributed code to all aspects of this system, as well has helping to define the concept behind the maps.nrel.gov site.</p>

               <p>I was brought in to maintain and enhance this site when the original developer moved on. I Modernized the software development process by creating development and staging environments and adding the source code to GIT. Made numerous enhancements to the site including updating the JPGraph charting library to a newer version and creating a web services interface to allow integration with Zapier. Switched the site to the HTTPS protocol to improve security. Used Linux shell scripting and Google Drive to implement automated database backups.</p>
